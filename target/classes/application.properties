# Congestion Detection Settings
# ========================================
# Utilization threshold to trigger congestion detection (percentage)
# Links above this threshold are considered congested

# Hysteresis value for congestion clearing (percentage)
# Congestion clears when utilization drops below (threshold - hysteresis)

# This prevents false positives from traffic spikes
